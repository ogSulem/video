# Approval workflow and asset manifest

**Project status:** REF-ARC-01, REF-CHAR-01, REF-INT-01, and REF-INT-02 are approved and locked. REF-SCENE-02-injury-aftermath was generated once and is awaiting user visual approval.
**Repository:** Workspace checkout `ogSulem/video`, branch `arena/f2208454-video`.

## Sequential approval gates

1. **Stage 1 — setup and creative direction:** approved.
2. **Stage 2 — master exterior architecture:** REF-ARC-01 generated once and approved; locked canonical facility exterior.
3. **Stage 3 — master skier:** REF-CHAR-01 generated once and approved; locked canonical skier identity and wardrobe.
4. **Stage 4 — interiors and equipment:** REF-INT-01 reception and REF-INT-02 rehabilitation room approved and locked. Specialized equipment remains unverified.
5. **Stage 5 — shot/continuity references:** REF-SCENE-02-injury-aftermath generated exactly once and awaiting user visual approval. No fall-action video, recovery images, or additional assets have been generated.
6. **Stage 6 — video:** generate clips in narrative order and review each batch before continuing.
7. **Stage 7 — finishing:** edit, sound, VO, Russian titles, verified brand card, and separately composed vertical cut.

No paid operation without explicit authorization. Do not skip gates or replace approved assets without explicit approval.

## Equipment verification status

The project documents do not confirm the center's actual equipment inventory or service availability. Specifically unconfirmed: cryotherapy/cold therapy; anti-gravity treadmill; therapy pool/aquatic rehabilitation; stabilometric platform; SkyTech or any other named ski simulator; biomechanical treadmills/sensors; and any other specialized diagnostic or exercise device. Do not depict or claim these until the facility confirms them and supplies references where needed. Generic furnishings in REF-INT-02 are illustrative, not verified inventory.

## Status vocabulary

`Draft` → `Awaiting approval` → `Approved` → `In production` → `QC review` → `Final`. Record the date/decision and accepted changes when approval occurs. A generated file is not an approved asset merely because it exists.

## Factual verification before public release

Confirm legal center name and location, facility existence, actual available procedures/devices, staff roles/credentials, safety protocols, substantiation of medical/performance claims, logo and tagline rights, and ownership/operation of `altaysportreab.ru`. Verify all title/VO language with the client and appropriate clinical/legal reviewers. Until then, names, services, equipment, and claims in scripts are placeholders, not facts.
